  abstract = {Across the NE Atlantic, the category ``gurnards'' may include as many as 8 different species. However, ICES landing statistics are not discriminated to species level. In Portugal, ``tub gurnard'' is the only species reported since 2000. The market sampling of the Data Collection Framework is the only reliable source of data for the definition of allocation keys for species composition in landings. Portuguese DCF market sampling data for the period 2009-2015 in Division IXa was used to estimate the total annual landings by species of gurnards. The influence of variables such as time, space and m{\'e}tier was assessed to derive the best species allocation key to re-construct the time series of landings by species. Based on this analysis, we discuss the implications for the current Portuguese market concurrent sampling of accommodating a sampling design aiming at estimating the species composition in landings of such unsorted categories.},
