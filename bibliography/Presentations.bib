  abstract = {The purse-seine fishery is the most important Portuguese fishery, accounting for 55\% of total landings by weight in 2019 (DGRM, 2020), targeting small pelagic species primarily sardine (Sardina pilchardus). With the decline of the sardine stock and the reduction of annual quotas, this fleet has supplemented its yields with chub mackerel (Scomber colias), horse mackerel (Trachurus trachurus) and anchovy (Engraulis encrasicolus). In 2019, major landings were split between these four species, mainly chub mackerel (57\%) and sardine (14\%). Ten years ago, the main species was sardine (80\%) and chub mackerel percentage was equivalent to present-day of sardine. To minimize landings of low-value or unmarketable fish and maximize the value of their overall landings, fishers slip unwanted catches. Compared to typical discarding, slipping leads to a lower fishing mortality rate as part of the catch is released alive. With the reduction of sardine quota, daily limits and long periods of sardine capture ban, the frequency and volume of sardine likely slipped will increase as the fleet directs the fishing effort to other pelagic species that are found typically mixed with sardine. Slipping is considered to be variable throughout the country and the year. Using onboard observed data in Portugal, we intend to describe and assess its occurrence at the fleet level, considering its variability. We present slipping patterns of sardine and chub mackerel in the Portuguese purse-seine fleet. We argue for the need of practices minimizing the need for slipping, such as sharing catch between vessels and improving identification of shoals.},

  abstract = {The purse seine fishery is one of the most important fisheries in Portugal, accounting for 50\% of total landings in weight. Historically, sardine (Sardina pilchardus) is the target species of the purse seine fleet.

With the reduction of sardine quota, daily limits and long periods of sardine capture ban, it is likely that the frequency and volume of sardine slipped will increase as the fleet directs the fishing effort to other pelagic species that are found tipically mixed with sardine. Although existing studies suggest that the survival of sardine after slipping may be low, a mandatory landing obligation for sardines could prove problematic for fishers and lead to a decrease of sardine survival. This work evaluates the implications, in terms of volume and income loss, of mandatory landings of sardine that could have otherwise been slipped. Practices to minimize the need for slipping, such as sharing catch between vessels and improving identification of shoals are discussed.},

  abstract = {In Portugal, small and medium pelagic species such as sardine (Sardina pilchardus), chub-mackerel (Scomber colias), anchovy (Engraulis encrasicolus) and horse mackerel (Trachurus trachurus) are the most landed species in the purse seine fishery, accounting for near 50\% of total landings in weight. Historically, sardine has been the target species of the fishery and traditionally perceived as the most important species in the fleet. With the decline of the sardine stock and the reduction of annual quotas, this fleet has supplemented its incomes by targeting chub-mackerel in the Center and South and anchovy in the North. The present work aims to analyse changes in fleet behavior concerning the reduction of annual quotas and the establishment of daily quotas for sardines in the period 2005-2020, to assess their impact on annual landing dynamics and improve the assessment of pelagic species. Behavior changes have been observed in the fleet along the country, such as searching for new fishing grounds and species with more market value such as anchovy. Especially, fisheries data may be an important supplement to information obtained from traditional surveys, that cover a part of the history. Having the full picture is important to get a better assessment of pelagic species and further discussion and/or sharing with stakeholders (e. g. fishers and fisher associations, fisheries researchers, the industry, NGO{\textasciiacute}s and general public).},

  abstract = {Length, Weight and their relationship of marine fish have been gained interest in the context of the ecosystem approach to fisheries and global change. Body conditions are influenced by environmental variability at seasonal and annual scale and are often used to evaluate individual growth patterns and reproductive potential at individual and population levels. Several studies on body condition have been published mainly in Bay of Biscay, English Channel and Mediterranean Sea. These studies showed a decreasing trend in body condition for Small Pelagic Species (SPF) which could impact the fishing and seafood industry sector. In the Atlantic Iberian Area, the sources of variability in fish condition has never been accurately understood or studied. Here, we investigated the variability in body condition and its responses to environmental changes for the main SPF targeted by purse-seine fleet in the Portuguese Coast; Sardine (Sardina pilchardus), Anchovy (Engraulis encrasicolus), Chub mackerel (Scomber colias) and Horse Mackerel (Trachurus trachurus), based on 30 years of morphometric data from both Acoustics scientific surveys and market samples. To evaluate allometric growth, length-weight relationships will be established. Body condition annual and seasonal trends will be modelled taking into account the variability explained by age classes and sex. Also the relative effects of environmental factors and catch levels on the inter annual variability of body condition will be quantified. Finally multivariate relationships among all small pelagic species body condition and exogenous factors will be described to characterize the state of the population and its global environment over the 30 years.},
