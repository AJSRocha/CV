  abstract = {Tub gurnard, Chelidonichthys lucerna (Linnaeus, 1758), is a Mediterranean-Atlantic benthic species usually captured as by-catch by Portuguese traditional fisheries and considered the most important commercial fish species of the family Triglidae. However, to date, little is known about its habitat residency and whether the species can be considered a marine estuarine-dependent fish. Otolith microchemistry has proven effective in providing information about fish movement patterns throughout different water salinities. In this study, core-to-edge transects of Sr:Ca in the fish saccular otoliths of 35 juveniles of C. lucerna captured in March 2007 by a scientific survey along the Portuguese coast were used to assess the species movement between brackish and marine waters. Data suggest that most individuals (97\%) have an estuarine-dependent profile, with 63\% showing a clear presence in marine waters during the early life history periods. Evidence of an estuarine residence throughout the fish life cycle was found in only 3\% of individuals. Ba:Ca profiles did not reflect an inverse relationship with Sr:Ca salinity results but corroborated findings from other authors about the influence of upwelling processes and freshwater runoffs on Ba incorporation into the otoliths of coastal fish. Furthermore, the data also showed that C. lucerna can occupy and migrate among habitats with diverse salinity degrees, showing high environmental plasticity and adaptation.},

  abstract = {In the Iberian Coast region, the common sole (Solea solea) is considered a very relevant species due to its high commercial value. Despite its importance, the current status of this stock is still poorly known due to the scarcity of available data to apply formal assessment methods. In data-poor situations length-based methods have been widely applied to estimate biological parameters and to understand the dynamics of marine stocks. In this study we evaluate the status of common sole in the Iberian Coast region using the following three different length-based methods: (1) the length-based indicators, (2) the length-based spawning potential ratio and (3) the mean length-based mortality estimators. Overall, the three methods agree that this stock appears to be exploited at the maximum sustainable yield level, the immatures are well preserved whereas the proportion of large mature individuals is relatively low, although it has been increased in the last years. Assessing the status of this valuable stock through data-limited methods is the first step towards designing and implementing effective management measures.},

Metals were determined in muscle tissues by Atomic Absorption Spectrometry. The main objectives of this work were: (i) study temporal variations and correlations between biological parameters and metals during fishing season; (ii) classify the ecological quality of Portuguese coast based on metals in this fish species and (iii) assess human health risks associated with their consumption. Biological parameters showed significant temporal variations.},
