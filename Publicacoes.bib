  abstract = {The purse-seine fishery is the most important Portuguese fishery, accounting for 55\% of total landings by weight in 2019 (DGRM, 2020), targeting small pelagic species primarily sardine (Sardina pilchardus). With the decline of the sardine stock and the reduction of annual quotas, this fleet has supplemented its yields with chub mackerel (Scomber colias), horse mackerel (Trachurus trachurus) and anchovy (Engraulis encrasicolus). In 2019, major landings were split between these four species, mainly chub mackerel (57\%) and sardine (14\%). Ten years ago, the main species was sardine (80\%) and chub mackerel percentage was equivalent to present-day of sardine. To minimize landings of low-value or unmarketable fish and maximize the value of their overall landings, fishers slip unwanted catches. Compared to typical discarding, slipping leads to a lower fishing mortality rate as part of the catch is released alive. With the reduction of sardine quota, daily limits and long periods of sardine capture ban, the frequency and volume of sardine likely slipped will increase as the fleet directs the fishing effort to other pelagic species that are found typically mixed with sardine. Slipping is considered to be variable throughout the country and the year. Using onboard observed data in Portugal, we intend to describe and assess its occurrence at the fleet level, considering its variability. We present slipping patterns of sardine and chub mackerel in the Portuguese purse-seine fleet. We argue for the need of practices minimizing the need for slipping, such as sharing catch between vessels and improving identification of shoals.},

Historically, sardine (Sardina pilchardus) is the target species of the purse seine fleet. With the decline of the sardine stock and the reduction of annual quotas, this fleet has supplemented its yields by targeting other pelagic species such as chub-mackerel (Scomber colias), horse mackerel (Trachurus trachurus) and anchovy (Engraulis encrasicolus).

Although existing studies suggest that the survival of sardine after slipping may be low, a mandatory landing obligation for sardines could prove problematic for fishers and lead to a decrease of sardine survival. This work evaluates the implications, in terms of volume and income loss, of mandatory landings of sardine that could have otherwise been slipped. Practices to minimize the need for slipping, such as sharing catch between vessels and improving identification of shoals are discussed.},

  abstract = {In Portugal, small and medium pelagic species such as sardine (Sardina pilchardus), chub-mackerel (Scomber colias), anchovy (Engraulis encrasicolus) and horse mackerel (Trachurus trachurus) are the most landed species in the purse seine fishery, accounting for near 50\% of total landings in weight. Historically, sardine has been the target species of the fishery and traditionally perceived as the most important species in the fleet. With the decline of the sardine stock and the reduction of annual quotas, this fleet has supplemented its incomes by targeting chub-mackerel in the Center and South and anchovy in the North. The present work aims to analyse changes in fleet behavior concerning the reduction of annual quotas and the establishment of daily quotas for sardines in the period 2005-2020, to assess their impact on annual landing dynamics and improve the assessment of pelagic species. Behavior changes have been observed in the fleet along the country, such as searching for new fishing grounds and species with more market value such as anchovy. Especially, fisheries data may be an important supplement to information obtained from traditional surveys, that cover a part of the history. Having the full picture is important to get a better assessment of pelagic species and further discussion and/or sharing with stakeholders (e. g. fishers and fisher associations, fisheries researchers, the industry, NGO{\textasciiacute}s and general public).},

  abstract = {Tub gurnard, Chelidonichthys lucerna (Linnaeus, 1758), is a Mediterranean-Atlantic benthic species usually captured as by-catch by Portuguese traditional fisheries and considered the most important commercial fish species of the family Triglidae. However, to date, little is known about its habitat residency and whether the species can be considered a marine estuarine-dependent fish. Otolith microchemistry has proven effective in providing information about fish movement patterns throughout different water salinities. In this study, core-to-edge transects of Sr:Ca in the fish saccular otoliths of 35 juveniles of C. lucerna captured in March 2007 by a scientific survey along the Portuguese coast were used to assess the species movement between brackish and marine waters. Data suggest that most individuals (97\%) have an estuarine-dependent profile, with 63\% showing a clear presence in marine waters during the early life history periods. Evidence of an estuarine residence throughout the fish life cycle was found in only 3\% of individuals. Ba:Ca profiles did not reflect an inverse relationship with Sr:Ca salinity results but corroborated findings from other authors about the influence of upwelling processes and freshwater runoffs on Ba incorporation into the otoliths of coastal fish. Furthermore, the data also showed that C. lucerna can occupy and migrate among habitats with diverse salinity degrees, showing high environmental plasticity and adaptation.},

Despite its importance, the current status of this stock is still poorly known due to the scarcity of available data to apply formal assessment methods. In data-poor situations length-based methods have been widely applied to estimate biological parameters and to understand the dynamics of marine stocks. In this study we evaluate the status of common sole in the Iberian Coast region using the following three different length-based methods: (1) the length-based indicators, (2) the length-based spawning potential ratio and (3) the mean length-based mortality estimators. Overall, the three methods agree that this stock appears to be exploited at the maximum sustainable yield level, the immatures are well preserved whereas the proportion of large mature individuals is relatively low, although it has been increased in the last years. Assessing the status of this valuable stock through data-limited methods is the first step towards designing and implementing effective management measures.},

The market sampling of the Data Collection Framework is the only reliable source of data for the definition of allocation keys for species composition in landings. Portuguese DCF market sampling data for the period 2009-2015 in Division IXa was used to estimate the total annual landings by species of gurnards. The influence of variables such as time, space and m{\'e}tier was assessed to derive the best species allocation key to re-construct the time series of landings by species. Based on this analysis, we discuss the implications for the current Portuguese market concurrent sampling of accommodating a sampling design aiming at estimating the species composition in landings of such unsorted categories.},

  abstract = {Length, Weight and their relationship of marine fish have been gained interest in the context of the ecosystem approach to fisheries and global change. Body conditions are influenced by environmental variability at seasonal and annual scale and are often used to evaluate individual growth patterns and reproductive potential at individual and population levels. Several studies on body condition have been published mainly in Bay of Biscay, English Channel and Mediterranean Sea. These studies showed a decreasing trend in body condition for Small Pelagic Species (SPF) which could impact the fishing and seafood industry sector. In the Atlantic Iberian Area, the sources of variability in fish condition has never been accurately understood or studied. Here, we investigated the variability in body condition and its responses to environmental changes for the main SPF targeted by purse-seine fleet in the Portuguese Coast; Sardine (Sardina pilchardus), Anchovy (Engraulis encrasicolus), Chub mackerel (Scomber colias) and Horse Mackerel (Trachurus trachurus), based on 30 years of morphometric data from both Acoustics scientific surveys and market samples. To evaluate allometric growth, length-weight relationships will be established. Body condition annual and seasonal trends will be modelled taking into account the variability explained by age classes and sex. Also the relative effects of environmental factors and catch levels on the inter annual variability of body condition will be quantified. Finally multivariate relationships among all small pelagic species body condition and exogenous factors will be described to characterize the state of the population and its global environment over the 30 years.},
